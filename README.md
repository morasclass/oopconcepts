# oopconcepts

Go to http://morasclass.com/morasclass/javatutorials/java/concepts/index.html and ride that trail from "What is an Object" through "What is a Package"  answer the questions in this readme and push up to your repo.

There are two exercises at the end of the trail that ask you to create a class and an interface.  Do these two things as best as you can!  Make sure everything makes sense, compiles, and is reviewed by a peer!  Stage, commit, and push those files up to your repo along with an edited version of README.md that has your end-of-trail answers in it.
